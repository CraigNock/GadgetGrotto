You should document your endpoints in this file.

The "/homePage" endpoint is the home page endpoint. It will return an array of 3 featured items after filtering through the data for the 3 items with the highest stock.

the "/:category" endpoint will serve to sort through the list of items and return those who are specific to the user's selection.
