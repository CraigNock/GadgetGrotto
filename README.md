# Gadget Grotto E-Commerce Project

Developed alongside 3 colleagues, an e-commerce app in React. Serves, filters and sells health related gadgets. Log in for a full streamlined user experience and check out the dark mode setting for ease of night time shopping.

This group project was made  as part of the Full-Stack Web Development Diploma with <a href='https://concordiabootcamps.ca/' alt='link to Concordia Bootcamps website'>Concordia Bootcamps</a>.

The original app was created using static, json file, data. 

After completion MongoDB integration for data storage and access, was added by me to this instance of the project personally.

## Installing
**Note** that a Mongo Database will need to be set up using the included Batch-Import.js file.
1. Clone the repo.
2. With a running mongoDB just uncomment the function call in BatchImport.js and run the file using node.
3. In both client and server directory terminals, run commands ```$yarn install``` and  ```$yarn start```.

**Alternatively:** json data and original endpoints are present, but commented out. Switch commenting with mongo endpoints to run with local data.
